# OpenEdge Samples #

This repository is organized to support two primary purposes:

### `/projects`

OpenEdge projects which can be directly imported into either the Progress Developer Studio or Visual Studio Code (please see templates for proper structure). These projects are intended to be self-contained and include everything needed to build that project locally, including database structure and definition files, Gradle build files, and all source code.

### `/examples`

Standalone examples of ABL code or related OpenEdge technologies. These examples should aid in illustrating specific features or functions within the OpenEdge products.
